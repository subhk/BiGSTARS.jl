## What can I do?
 - Bug fixes – if something fails or behaves oddly.
 - New features / extensions – e.g. new base flows, boundary conditions, or diagnostics.
 - Performance improvements – more efficient linear algebra, better use of sparse matrices, etc.
 - Documentation – clarifying docstrings, user docs in docs/, or worked examples in examples/.
 - Testing – adding coverage for edge cases, new solvers, or new physics.

If you’re interested in working on something, please let us know by commenting on 
an existing issue or opening a new one. This helps avoid duplicated work and gives
