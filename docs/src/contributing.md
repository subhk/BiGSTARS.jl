# Contributors' Guide

This is a short guide for potential BiGSTARS.jl contributors.

Please feel free to ask us questions and chat, either by raising an [issue](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl/issues) or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl/discussions).

We follow the [ColPrac guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) for collaborative practices. 
New contributors should make sure to read that guide.
