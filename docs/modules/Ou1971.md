### Baroclinic instability






The resulting nondimensional, linearized Boussinesq equations of motion under the $f$-plane approximation are given by
```math
\begin{align}
    \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{Dt}
    + \Big(v \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \Big) \hat{x}
    + \hat{z} \times \mathbf{u} &=
    -\nabla p + \frac{1}{\epsilon} b \hat{z} + E \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}, \\
    \frac{Db}{Dt}
    +  v \frac{\partial B}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial B}{\partial z} &= \frac{E}{Pr} \nabla^2 b, \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0,
\end{align}
```
where 
```math
D/Dt \equiv \partial/\partial t + U (\partial/\partial x)$
```
is the material derivative, ``\mathbf{u} \equiv (u, v, \epsilon w)`` is the velocity perturbation, ``\epsilon=H/R`` is the aspect ratio, ``p`` is the pressure perturbation, and ``b`` is the buoyancy perturbation. The operator 
```math
\nabla \equiv (\partial/\partial x, \partial/\partial y, (1/\epsilon) \partial/\partial z),
```
```math
\nabla^2 \equiv \partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2 + (1/\epsilon^2) \partial^2/ \partial z^2,
```
where 

```math
\nabla_h^2 \equiv \partial^2 /\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2.
```
The benefit of using the above sets of equations is that it enables us to examine the instability at an along-front wavenumber ``k \to 0``. 
The horizontal velocities ``u`` and ``v`` are related to the vertical velocity ``w`` and vertical vorticity ``\zeta`` by the identities, 
\begin{align}
    \nabla_h^2 u &= -\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x \partial z}, 
\\
    \nabla_h^2 v &= \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y \partial z}.    
\end{align}
In deriving the above equations, we make use of the continuity equation and the definition of vertical vorticity ``\zeta``.
